  // Test basic functionality
  final policyManager = PolicyManager();
  await policyManager.initialize({
    "test": ["test_content"]
  });

  print("Flutter Policy Engine installed successfully!");

  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Installation Test',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Installation Test')),
