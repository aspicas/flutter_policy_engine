# Flutter Policy Engine

A powerful and flexible policy management system designed specifically for Flutter applications. The Flutter Policy Engine provides comprehensive role-based access control (RBAC) capabilities with an intuitive API and seamless integration with Flutter widgets.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Define roles with specific permissions and content access
- **Dynamic Policy Management**: Add, update, and remove roles at runtime
- **Widget Integration**: Built-in `PolicyWidget` for easy UI integration
- **Memory Storage**: Efficient in-memory policy storage with extensible architecture
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling and validation
- **Type Safety**: Full Dart type safety with null safety support

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The Flutter Policy Engine is built with a modular architecture that separates concerns and promotes maintainability:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   PolicyWidget  │    │  PolicyProvider  │    │ PolicyManager   │
│   (UI Layer)    │◄──►│  (Context)       │◄──►│  (Core Logic)   │
└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
                                                         │
                                                         ▼
                                              ┌──────────────────┐
                                              │ Policy Storage   │
                                              │ (Memory/Extensible)│
                                              └──────────────────┘
```

## 📦 Core Components

### PolicyManager

The central orchestrator that handles policy initialization, role management, and access evaluation.

### PolicyProvider

A Flutter widget that provides policy context to the widget tree, enabling child widgets to access policy information.

### PolicyWidget

A conditional widget that renders content based on the current user's role and permissions.

### Role Model

A data structure representing a role with its associated permissions and allowed content.

## 🎯 Quick Example

```dart
// Initialize the policy manager
final policyManager = PolicyManager();
await policyManager.initialize({
  "admin": ["LoginPage", "Dashboard", "UserManagement", "Settings"],
  "user": ["LoginPage", "Dashboard"],
  "guest": ["LoginPage"]
});

// Wrap your app with PolicyProvider
PolicyProvider(
  policyManager: policyManager,
  child: MaterialApp(
    home: MyHomePage(),
  ),
);

// Use PolicyWidget for conditional rendering
PolicyWidget(
  role: "admin",
  content: "UserManagement",
  child: UserManagementPage(),
  fallback: AccessDeniedWidget(),
)
```
