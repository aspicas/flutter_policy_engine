# flutter_policy_engine_example

A comprehensive example demonstrating how to use the `flutter_policy_engine` library for implementing Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Flutter applications.

## Overview

The `flutter_policy_engine` library provides a lightweight, extensible policy engine for Flutter applications. It allows you to define, manage, and evaluate access control rules declaratively using ABAC or RBAC models.

## Features Demonstrated

- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Define policies based on user attributes, resource properties, and environmental factors
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement role-based permissions with hierarchical role structures
- **Declarative Rule Definitions**: Define policies using a clean, readable syntax
- **Extensible Design**: Easily extend the engine with custom evaluators and conditions
- **Flutter Integration**: Seamless integration with Flutter widgets and state management

## Installation

Add the `flutter_policy_engine` dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_policy_engine: ^0.0.1
```

Then run:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Basic Usage

### 1. Import the Library

```dart
import 'package:flutter_policy_engine/flutter_policy_engine.dart';
```
